# Movie_Trailer_website
Udacity Full Stack Project 1 Movie Trailer website. Server-side code to store a list of movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 

#### Running the Movie_Trailer_website program
0. Do you have python? If so, go to step two. If not, [download it here ](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This program was built in Python 2.7.9.

1. Download Entertainment_center.py, media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py to your local machine and unzip them all into a folder.

2. Open the Python Gui (IDLE) from your system menu and open Entertainment_center.py from file. Take a moment review it. I assume my favorite movies are your favorite movies beacuse mine are the best movies ever. If you want to be wrong and choose other movies, you can follow the formatting from the great movies displayed. Here is the structure inside media.py (self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube). 
3. Save you work (cntrl + S) and hit f5. A browser window should pop up with the greatest movies ever, or your version of that.
4. Bask in the glow of your wonderful work. If not, let me know and I will help you fix it.

The first component of this project is a list of lists of movie data is Entertainment_center.py. The second component is the small but powerful media.py. Media.py gives general formatting and struture to the lists in Entertainment_center.py. Fresh_tomatoes.py compiles the lists in Entertaimnent_center.py utilizing the structure of media.py to create a .html file.
